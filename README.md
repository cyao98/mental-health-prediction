Mental health issues plague a large portion of the human population and an even larger portion of workers in the tech field. Currently, around 51% of workers in the tech field report facing distress and seeking treatment for their mental health issues yearly.  Through this project, I explored the data gathered from a survey on mental health attitudes in tech field. Then, I trained a machine learning model to be able to predict how different work environment, benefits and work wellness programs effect an employees percieved difficulty with discussing mental health issues. These insights could help tech comapnies and human resources departments with implementing better resources and employee outreach based on the company enviornment and culture.
