Mental health issues plague a large portion of the human population, and an even larger portion of workers in the tech field. Around 51% of workers in the tech field report facing distress and seeking treatment for their mental health issues yearly. The tech field is often a workplace filled with pressure, stress, burnout from long working hours and isolation, due to the nature of work in technology. People are paying more attention to the topic than in previous years, so companies have the potential to make mental health resources and work life balance better. A classification model for predicting if people need treatment could be used to help companies strongly identify which patients should be treated, implement better initiatives, and reallocate resources and money to the right places.
